This is my implementation of the [Tip Calculator App](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX) challenge from Frontend Mentor. The goal was to create an interactive tip calculator that accurately replicates the appearance and functionality of the original design. 🏆✨📱

## Challenge 🎯🚀🔍
The biggest challenge in this project was accurately reproducing the look and behavior of the application. I believe I have achieved this goal, and I am satisfied with the final result. ✅💪😊

## Technologies 🛠️📜⚡
The project was built using:
- TypeScript
- ESBuild
- HTML5
- SCSS (Mobile-first workflow)
- Flexbox & CSS Grid

## What I Learned 📚🎓🖥️
While working on this project:
- I created my own starter with `package.json` for ESBuild,
- I reviewed and reinforced my knowledge of various event listeners in JavaScript,
- I discovered the CSS `caret-color` property, which allows changing the cursor color in an input field. ✍️🎨🔍

```css
input {
    caret-color: transparent;

    &::placeholder {
      color: green;
    }
  
    &:focus::placeholder {
      color: transparent;
    }
}
```

Thanks to this, the placeholder disappears when the input field is active, and the cursor remains invisible. 🧐🎯✅
